# Ping Pong
This project is part of the KTH course Embedded Systems IS1300. And follows the description: 
There are two players, L and R (Left and Right). The player who serves presses their button, which causes LEDs to light up one by one to animate the movement of a ball toward the opponent. The ball is returned if the button is pressed when the outermost LED is lit. If a player presses the button too early or too late, they miss the ball, and the opponent scores a point. A missed ball is indicated by briefly flashing all LEDs, followed by displaying the score. After a point is won or lost, the score is shown briefly by lighting up as many LEDs on each side as corresponds to each player’s points. Players take turns serving. At the start, either player can serve, but the next serve always switches to the other player. For example, if the left player serves first, the right player serves next, regardless of who lost the previous point. The first player to reach four points wins. The result is displayed for five seconds before the game resets. The time each LED remains lit decreases based on how long the ball has been in play, increasing the “ball speed” and making it more challenging to return the ball. It may be useful to set a maximum ball speed.
